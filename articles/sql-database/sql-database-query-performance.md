# Azure SQL Database Query Performance Insight


Managing and tuning the performance of relational databases is a challenging task that requires significant expertise and time investment. Query Performance Insight allows you to spend less time troubleshooting database performance by providing the following:​

- Deeper insight into your databases resource (DTU) consumption. 
- The top CPU consuming queries, which can potentially be tuned for improved performance. 
- The ability to drill down into the details of a query.
​

## Prerequisites

- Query Performance Insight is only available with Azure SQL Database V12.
- Query Performance Insight requires that [Query Store](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dn817826.aspx) is running on your database. The portal will prompt you to turn Query Store on if it is not already running.

 
## Permissions

The following [role-based access control](role-based-access-control-configure.md) permissions are required to use Query Performance Insight: 

- **Reader**, **Owner**, **Contributor**, **SQL DB Contributor** or **SQL Server Contributor** permissions are required to view the top resource consuming queries and charts. 
- **Owner**, **Contributor**, **SQL DB Contributor** or **SQL Server Contributor** permissions are required to view query text.



## Using Query Performance Insight

Query Performance Insight is easy to use:

- Review the list of top resource-consuming queries. 
- Select an individual query to view it's details.
- Click **Settings** to customize how data is displayed or to show a different time period.



> [AZURE.NOTE] A couple hours of data needs to be captured by Query Store for SQL Database to provide query performance insight. If the database has no activity or Query Store was not active during a certain time period, the charts will be empty when displaying that time period. You may enable Query Store at any time if it is not running.   



## Review top CPU consuming queries

In the [portal](https://portal.azure.com) do the following:

1. Browse to a SQL database and click **Query Performance Insight**. 

    ![Query Performance Insight][1]

    The top queries view opens and the list of top CPU consuming queries are listed.

1. Click around the chart for details.<br>The top line shows overall DTU% for the database, while the bars show CPU% consumed by the selected queries. Select or clear individual queries to include or exclude them from the chart.

    ![top queries][2]

1. Optionally, click **Edit chart** to customize how CPU consumption data is displayed, or to show a different time period.

## Viewing individual query details

To view query details:

1. Click any query in the list of top queries.<br>The details view opens and the queries CPU consumption is broken down over time.
3. Click around the chart for details.<br>The top line is overall DTU%, and the bars are CPU% consumed by the selected query.
4. Review the data to see detailed metrics including duration, number of executions, and resource utilization percentage for each interval the query was running.
    
    ![query details][3]

1. Optionally, click **Settings** to customize how CPU consumption data is displayed, or to show a different time period.




## Summary

Query Performance Insight helps you understand the impact of your query workload and how it relates to database resource consumption. With this feature, you will learn about the top consuming queries, and easily identify the ones to fix before they become a problem. Click the **Query Performance Insight** tile on a database blade to see the top resource (CPU) consuming queries. 




## Next steps

Database workloads are dynamic and change continuously. Monitor your queries and continue to fine tune them to refine performance. 

Check out the [Index Advisor](sql-database-index-advisor.md) for additional recommendations for improving the performance of your SQL database.
