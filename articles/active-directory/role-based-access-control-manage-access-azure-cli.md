## List RBAC roles
###	List all available roles
To list all available roles use:

		azure role list

The following example shows the list of *all available roles*.

###	List actions of a role
To list the actions of a role use:

    azure role show <role in quotes>

The following example shows the actions of the *Contributor* and *Virtual Machine Contributor* roles.

##	List access
###	List role assignments effective on a resource group
To list role assignments effective on a resource group  use:

    azure role assignment list --resource-group <resource group name>

The following example shows the role assignments effective on the *pharma-sales-projecforcast* group.

![](./media/role-based-access-control-manage-access-azure-cli/4-azure-role-assignment-list-1.png)

###	List role assignments to a user, including ones assigned to a user's groups

The following example shows the role assignments effective on the *pharma-sales-projecforcast* group.

![](./media/role-based-access-control-manage-access-azure-cli/4-azure-role-assignment-list-2.png)

##	Grant access
Once you have identified the role you wish to assign, to grant access use:

    azure role assignment create

###	Assign role to group at subscription scope
To assign a role to a group at the subscription scope use:

   azure role assignment create --objId  <group's object id> --role <name of role> --scope <subscription/subscription id>

The following example assigns the *Reader* role to *Christine Koch's Team* at the *subscription* scope.

![](./media/role-based-access-control-manage-access-azure-cli/2-azure-role-assignment-create-1.png)

###	Assign role to application at subscription scope
To assign a role to an application at the subscription scope use:

    azure role assignment create --objId  <applications's object id> --role <name of role> --scope <subscription/subscription id>

Following example grants the *Contributor* role to an *Azure AD* application on the selected subscription.

 ![](./media/role-based-access-control-manage-access-azure-cli/2-azure-role-assignment-create-2.png)

###	Assign role to user at resource group scope
To assign a role to a user at the resource group scope use:

    azure role assignment create --signInName  <user's email address> --roleName <name of role in quotes> --resourceGroup <resource group name>

Following example grants the *Virtual Machine Contributor* role to user *samert@aaddemo.com* at the *Pharma-Sales-ProjectForcast* resource group scope.

![](./media/role-based-access-control-manage-access-azure-cli/2-azure-role-assignment-create-3.png)

###	Assign role to group at resource scope
To assign a role to a group at the resource scope use:

    azure role assignment create --objId  <group id> --roleName <name of role in quotes> --resource-name <resource group name> --resource-type <resource group type> --parent <resource group parent> --resource-group <resource group>

Following example grants the *Virtual Machine Contributor* role to an *Azure AD* group on a *subnet*.

![](./media/role-based-access-control-manage-access-azure-cli/2-azure-role-assignment-create-4.png)

##	Remove access
To remove a role assignment, use:

    azure role assignment delete --objId <object id to from which to remove role> --roleName <role name>

Following example removes the *Virtual Machine Contributor* role assignment from *sammert@aaddemo.com* on the *Pharma-Sales-ProjectForcast* resource group.
Then, it removes the role assignment from a group on the subscription.

## Create a custom role
To create a custom role, use `azure role create` command.

The following example creates a custom role called *Virtual Machine Operator* that grants access to all read operations of *Microsoft.Compute*, *Microsoft.Storage*, and *Microsoft.Network* resource providers, and grants access to start, restart, and monitor virtual machines. The custom role can be used in two subscriptions. This example employs a json file as an input.

## Modify a custom role

To modify a custom role first, use the azure role show command to retrieve role definition. Then, make desired changes to the role definition. Finally, use azure role set command to save the modified role definition.

The following example adds the Microsoft.Insights/diagnosticSettings/* operation to the Actions, and an Azure subscription to the AssignableScopes of the Virtual Machine Operator custom role.

![](./media/role-based-access-control-manage-access-azure-cli/3-azure-role-set2.png)

## Delete a custom role

To delete a custom role first, use the `azure role show` command to determine the **Id** of the role. Then, use `azure role delete` command to delete the role by specifying the **Id**.

The following example removes the *Virtual Machine Operator* custom role.

![](./media/role-based-access-control-manage-access-azure-cli/4-azure-role-delete.png)

## List custom roles

To list the roles that are available for assignment at a scope, use the `azure role list` command.

The following example lists all role available for assignment in the selected subscription.

![](./media/role-based-access-control-manage-access-azure-cli/5-azure-role-list1.png)

In the following example the *Virtual Machine Operator* custom role isn’t available in the *Production4* subscription because that subscription isn’t in the **AssignableScopes** of the role.
